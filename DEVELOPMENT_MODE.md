# ðŸ”“ Development Mode Setup

## Overview
I've temporarily deactivated all backend login restrictions so you can focus on frontend design and development. All authentication requirements have been bypassed.

## What's Been Modified

### 1. **AuthContext.tsx** - Authentication Bypass
- âœ… Always returns `isAuthenticated: true`
- âœ… Provides a mock user: "Developer User" (dev@example.com)
- âœ… All login/register/logout functions are mocked
- âœ… No token validation or API calls for auth

### 2. **SearchBar.tsx** - API Call Simplification
- âœ… Removed `Authorization` headers from API calls
- âœ… User preferences API calls work without tokens
- âœ… Layout changes are saved without authentication

### 3. **Navigation.tsx** - Development Banner
- âœ… Added red development mode banner at the top
- âœ… Shows "ðŸ”“ DEVELOPMENT MODE: Authentication bypassed"
- âœ… All navigation links are accessible

### 4. **Search Page** - Development Indicator
- âœ… Added development mode indicator below the banner
- âœ… Shows "ðŸ”“ DEVELOPMENT MODE: All features accessible without authentication"

## Current Status

### âœ… **Working Without Authentication:**
- Home page
- Search functionality
- Search results display
- History page (with mock data)
- Profile page (store management)
- Admin dashboard (with mock data)
- User preferences (layout switching)
- All navigation links

### ðŸ”’ **Still Protected (Backend Only):**
- Login/Register forms (but they auto-succeed)
- API endpoints (but they work without tokens)

## How to Start Development Server

### Option 1: PowerShell Script
```powershell
.\start-dev.ps1
```

### Option 2: Batch File
```cmd
start-dev.bat
```

### Option 3: Manual Command
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Start the server** using one of the methods above
2. **Navigate to any page** - all are accessible
3. **Test all features** - search, history, profile, admin
4. **Focus on design** - no authentication interruptions
5. **When ready for backend** - restore authentication in AuthContext.tsx

## Restoring Authentication Later

When you're ready to add backend restrictions back:

1. **Restore AuthContext.tsx** to its original state
2. **Add token validation** to protected routes
3. **Implement proper middleware** for route protection
4. **Remove development banners** from Navigation and Search pages

## Console Messages

You'll see these messages in the browser console:
- `ðŸ”“ Development mode: Authentication bypassed`
- `ðŸ”“ Development mode: Login bypassed`
- `ðŸ”“ Development mode: Registration bypassed`
- `ðŸ”“ Development mode: Logout bypassed`

## Current User State

- **User ID:** dev-user-123
- **Name:** Developer User
- **Email:** dev@example.com
- **Status:** Always authenticated
- **Role:** Full access to all features

**Note:** This is a temporary development setup. Remember to restore proper authentication before deploying to production!
